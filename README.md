# Hungry GF Project
This project is a part of the [Flatiron](http://https://flatironschool.com/) for Data Science
#### -- Project Status: [Incomplete]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to model a predictor of final choice that will accurately predict choice of a hungry GF    

### Methods Used
* Categorical Encoding


### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, numpy, category_encoders 
* Jupyter


## Project Description
Main use of project was fun way of dealing with categorical data given gf's responses.  I will show different encoding techniques and explain their purpose.
## Needs of this project

- Get data from a hungry gf
- data exploration
- data processing/cleaning
- Categorical encoding
- findings
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Asked gf simple questions of if she was hungry and gathered pertinent data needed to fulfill project
2. Csv data is being kept within this repo.   
3. Data processing/encoding scripts are being kept in this repo also

## Analysis
* Was able to work with categorical data
* Final choice high counts was IDLT
* Seems overwhelming result of choice was IDLT meanig I don't like that

## Future Improvements

- Get more data
- Make a model that will predict Gf's choice so as to save time on decidig where to eat
